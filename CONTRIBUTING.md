7. **Update documentation**: If your changes require it, update or add documentation to reflect your modifications or new features.

8. **Submit a pull request**: Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request to the main repository. Make sure to describe your changes and link to the issues they resolve.

9. **Review process**: The maintainers will review your pull request. Be open to feedback and be prepared to make further changes if required.

10. **Get merged!**: Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the project.

### Basic Git Workflow for Contributions

1. **Clone your forked repository**:

    ```

5. **Fetch the latest changes from the upstream before pushing**:
    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/main
    ```

6. **Push your branch to  your Github repository**:
    ```bash
    git push origin your-feature-branch-name
    ```

7. **Submit a pull request**:
    - Go to your repository on Github.
